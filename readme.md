### Front end test

The test is splited in three parts
- creation of a linked list and too functions to manipulate them
- two react components to display a linked list
- improve the react components style

Some part of the code *are dirty* but it's the purpose :)

run tests 
`./node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js`
